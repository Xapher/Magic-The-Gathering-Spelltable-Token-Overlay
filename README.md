# MtgOverlay
An overlay made for obs using a local web file. This repository is mainly for Migrating to online resources from original sources (Scryfall) instead of having to download every token.
For Spelltable use it will require having a version of OBS with the virtual camera.

To use:
In obs add a browser-source and set the URL to a Local file directing it to the index.html in this OR add the browser-source and direct it to the URL https://xapher.github.io/MtgOverlay/. After, you can start the virtual camera and use it in spelltable as the video feed for the game.
